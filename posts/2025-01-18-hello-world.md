It works.

I did it.

I made a [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet).

It's not how I wanted it to be, but I'll finish that later (probably never).

Well, now that it works at least in some form, I should really think about what I'll post here.
