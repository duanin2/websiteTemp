## Interests

Well I'm quite interested in [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology), but usually I'm more interested in the software side of things, like [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) & [Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).

### Programming

I mainly program in [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) or [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), sometimes even with some [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), but I also know some [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP).

When I am using HTML and CSS, I mainly just use plain HTML and CSS without any frameworks, because usually I'm making the website as a school assignment and we can't really use any frameworks there and also because I don't really know any frameworks well enough. I also use my JS plain, except TS.

I only really know PHP and C#, because I learned them at school.

### Music

If you're interested in what kind of music I like, I mainly listen [Vocaloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid) (& other [voice synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis)) music and [video game OSTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_music).

## My setup

This website is hosted on a [headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer) Raspberry Pi 5 8GB running NixOS with [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
I use Nginx as a load balancer proxy.

My laptop also runs NixOS with Home Manager, but it's an [Acer Aspire E5-575G](https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=ff31b68cf3).
I use [KDE Plasma 6](https://kde.org/) as [DE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) on it and I manage its configuration using [Plasma Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/plasma-manager/).
I use Firefox with [Arkenfox user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) as my primary and only web browser.
I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) as my code editor.
